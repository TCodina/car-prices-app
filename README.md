# car-prices-app
This repository contains a simple linear regression model that predicts car prices from certain car features. A thorough explanation of the model step by step can be found in [this post](https://tcodina.github.io/notes/linear_regression_practice).

The app is fully contained in the car_price_app.py file. An example of how to train, save, load and evaluate the model is given in the main.py file. utils.py contains some plot functions useful for visualization.
